Trac Hooks
==========

trac-post-commit-hook
---------------------

The trac-post-commit-hook script searches commit messages for text in
the form of:

.. code:: wiki

   command #1
   command #1, #2
   command #1 & #2
   command #1 and #2

You can have more then one command in a message. The following commands
are supported. There is more then one spelling for each command, to make
this as user-friendly as possible.

.. code:: wiki

   closes, fixes

-  The specified issue numbers are closed with the contents of this
   commit message being added to it.

.. code:: wiki

   references, refs, addresses, re

-  The specified issue numbers are left in their current status, but the
   contents of this commit message are added to their notes.

A fairly complicated example of what you can do is with a commit message
of:

.. code:: wiki

   Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes #10 and #12, and refs #12.

-  This will close #10 and #12, and add a note to #12.

trac-post-revprop-change-hook
-----------------------------

With the trac-post-revprop-change-hook script one could change the
svn:log property. The syntax is:

.. code:: wiki

   1. svn propset svn:log --revprop -r <REVISION> "My corrected log message" <URL>
   2. svn propset svn:log --revprop -r <REVISION> -F <file-with-corrected-log-message.txt> <URL>
   3. svn propedit svn:log --revprop -r <REVISION>

For easy usage add a "svn comment edit" alias to your .bash_profile:

.. code:: wiki

   export SVN_EDITOR=vi (or whatever)
   alias svnceF='svn propedit svn:log --revprop http://svn.freetz.org/ -r'

Your editor will start after

.. code:: wiki

   svnceF <REVISION>
