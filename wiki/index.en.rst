Welcome to Freetz
=================

**Freetz** (more about the name and history in the
`FAQs <FAQ.en.html>`__) is a firmware-extension (modification) for the
`​AVM Fritz!Box <http://www.avm.de/en/Produkte/FRITZBox/index.html>`__
and devices with identical hardware. The original firmware from the
manufacturer is extended with new functions and programs which may be
selected by the user. *Freetz* is `​free
software <http://www.germany.fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware.en.html>`__
and is developed by Oliver Metz, Alexander Kriegisch and others.

**Warning: the installation of a modified firmware invalidates the
manufacturer's warranty!**

Since most of the development team and users are German, most of this
website is written in the German language.

Building and using
------------------

*Freetz* can only be built using Linux. See the README file in the root
directory of the checked-out source-code, as well as the `​IPPF
Wiki <http://wiki.ip-phone-forum.de/software:ds-mod:installation#linux>`__
(in German) for the list of tools/packages required to successfully
build *Freetz*. If you're really in a hurry make sure you've got all the
required tools installed and then do

.. code:: wiki

   make menuconfig
   make

This gives you first a menu-based configuration and then builds your
custom firmware. Enjoy!
