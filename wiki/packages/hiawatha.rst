You might want to add this or similar to the extra configuration:

.. code:: wiki

   BanOnGarbage = 300
   BanOnMaxPerIP = 60
   BanOnMaxReqSize = 300
   KickOnBan = yes
   RebanDuringBan = yes

And you might want to limit the number of simultaneous connections too:

.. code:: wiki

   ConnectionsTotal = 5
   ConnectionsPerIP = 3
