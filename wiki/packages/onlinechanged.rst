Onlinechanged
=============

You can send yourself an e-mail when your box comes online like this:

.. code:: wiki

     online)
       mailer -s "Freetz online" -t <your e-mail address>
       ;;

For this to work, you should configure the `​AVM Push
service <http://fritz.box/system/push.lua>`__, but it is not necessary
to enable it.
