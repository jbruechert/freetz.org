   E-MailRelay

Von der Webseite des Herstellers:

   E-MailRelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message
   transfer agent (MTA). When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can
   be passed through a user-defined program, such as a spam filter,
   which can drop, re-address or edit messages as they pass through.
   When running as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages are stored
   in a local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next SMTP
   server on request.

   E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server. Messages received over
   SMTP can be automatically dropped into several independent POP3
   mailboxes.
